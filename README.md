Pycharm
Python3 한글 처리
* Python3의 기본 문자 -> UNICODE
* Window를 사용하는 경우 encoding이 cp949를 따른다.   
(즉, ms949(cp949) ANSI 등의 인코딩을 사용하는 파일 데이터는 쉽게 읽고 쓸 수 있다.)

| Data providers or sites (.txt, .csv, .xlsx etc.) | No need to collect it yourself | There is no way to communicate in real time when information changes & Time consuming |
| **Web crawling** | Can collect data on almost any web | Difficult to parsing and analysis source code on the web & Risk of copyright infringement |
| Get database access | Easy to collect structured data | Security risks |
| **Data Provider API** | Solve the problem of security and real-time delivery | Limited data collection |
